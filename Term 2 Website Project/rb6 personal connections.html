<h2> Why do I love this game?</h2>

<p> I love this game because it's incredibly unique and every time you play it it's always different. I also like that there are many different characters with different "stats" and my absolute favourite part is that you can break walls. You can break most walls like wood or anything with wooden supports but you can't break walls with metal supports.  </p>

<h2> What experiences do I have with the game? </h2>

<p> I don't really have a lot of experiences with playing the game but I do enjoy watching gameplays. I've played the game only once with my sister's laptop since my computer is a apple product. I'll admit I wasn't the best at the game since I was playing with unfamiliar controls and keys and also Rainbow Six is an extremely difficult game to get good at since you have to become familiar with maps and spawning places and characters. So I played it for an hour than I quit. Watching is still fun though! </p>
